# Alzheimer-Prediction
Alzheimer's Prediction using different Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms

In this project, I have employed a comprehensive suite of machine learning and deep learning
algorithms to address the research objectives. The machine learning techniques utilized include
RandomForest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). In the realm of deep learning, the models implemented are
DenseNet121, MobileNet, and Xception. Additionally, this study introduces a hybrid model 
combining CNN and K-Means algorithms, aiming to leverage the strengths of both
approaches. 

The dataset was divided into two folders based on their labels: The "Alzheimer’s" folder
included images graded 1,2, or 3, while the "no Alzheimer’s" folder contained images graded 0.
This categorization aimed to classify images into binary categories based on the presence or
absence of Alzheimer’s.

A typical personal computer's CPU is used to implement these algorithms for
testing, validation, and training. Furthermore, the dataset is supplemented with augmentation
techniques, which increase its diversity and guarantee thorough model training.

The dataset used for this project is taken by Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images
